# Angular2 TodoApp

##TodoApp using Angular2 with typescript
***************

The main motive of this app to learn about the basics of **Angular2** and **json-server**.
Every front end developer will learn new front end *frameworks* and *libraries* via doing a
todo-app. we need data to manipulate it for todo-app. For that we will depend on *backend*,
But we are front end guys. To overcome that problem, I have learnt json-server, and I have
used it in this app.

[Refer official json-server docs for more operations](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).
